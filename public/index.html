            These need to be encoded, for example, using one hot encoding bag of words and coding or and weddings as we will see and admitting, is it rain a bit dense factor that represent a cat a category are two can one option two hundred all this preprocessing easy to write your own custom preprocessing least I know that is to use this done preprocessing layers provided by Get Us in this chapter, they ' ve been covered the do type yea and bf record for make and how to create custom preprocessing list and use the standard get us what.\
            We will also take a quick look at the few related products from to ten Settlers ecosystem, the of transform makes it possible to write a single preprocessing function that can be around in each batch.    \
            More on your full training said before training and then export a to be a function and incorporated into your train one and so that once it is that blood in production, it can make or it get off preprocessing new instances on the fly df datasets but away or convenient function to dial learn many common data set of all kinds, including large ones like image neck as well as convenient it as an object though many blood then using the data a Yeah, so let ' s get started."
